    "Data transformation. A wide range of data transformation functions are available to reshape your data into a more suitable structure for analysis, such as filtering, sorting, grouping, merging, splitting columns into multiple fields, creating calculated columns, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleansing. Data quality is crucial for accurate analysis. PQ provides tools to identify and correct errors, remove duplicates, trim extra spaces, fill missing values, and standardize formats, ensuring that your data is clean and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining data. PQ makes it simple to combine and merge data from different locations into a single cohesive dataset, facilitating comprehensive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automating workflows. Power Query records every step you take, creating a query that can be easily modified or reused later. This is especially useful when dealing with recurring data sources or when you want to keep your analysis up to date with minimal effort. Also, you can refresh your query to get the latest data from the source at any time, on demand or on a schedule.\n",

    "Once your data is loaded into Power Query, you're in the driver's seat to refine it according to your needs. All data transformations are done within a separate interface called the Power Query Editor, where you have four main tabs to explore. You can think of data transformation as sculpting. You start with a raw material that you shape into a form that suits your purpose and that allows you to create appealing reports and dashboards.\n",

    "Here are some common transformations you can perform using Power Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort and filter. Arrange data in ascending or descending order and filter out unwanted rows to focus on the information that matters most.\n",
    "Add, remove or duplicate columns. Modify your dataset by adding new columns, removing unnecessary ones, or duplicating existing columns when needed.\n",
    "Change data type. You can specify the type of data in each column, such as text, number, date, time, etc.\n",
    "Transpose row to column and vice versa. Change the orientation of your data, transforming rows into columns for better analysis and visualization.\n",
    "Remove duplicate rows. You can eliminate any rows that have identical values in all columns to reduce the size of your data and to avoid double-counting\n",
    "Trim and clean. Remove leading or trailing spaces from your text values, or any extra characters that are not part of the data to improve the quality and readability of your dataset.\n",
    "Extract values. Extract parts of your text values based on a delimiter, position, or pattern. For example, you can extract the first name from a full name column, or the domain name from an email address column.\n",
    "Split column. Divide a column into multiple columns based on a delimiter or a specific pattern. For example, you can split a date column into year, month, and day columns.\n",
    "Replace or remove values or errors. You can replace any values or errors in your data with another value, such as a blank, zero, or custom value. You can also delete any rows that contain errors or missing values.\n",
    "Add conditional column. Create new columns based on predefined conditions, allowing for dynamic data categorization. For example, you can create a column that assigns a category based on a numerical range.\n",
    "Add column from example. Utilize examples to guide Power Query in creating new columns with desired data patterns. PQ will try to infer the logic behind your examples and apply it to the rest of the rows.\n",
    "Group and summarize data. Aggregate data by groups, calculate sums, averages, or other statistical measures for deeper insights.\n"
